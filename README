# Why Serialize?
      
  In some cases, (for example adding users to linux box) if you try to run your functions in parallel it will fail.
  
  You want to have very simple queue, that will register each incoming function, and execute it one by one. For example:
  
    serializer = require "./lib/serializer"
    
    exampleFunction = (x,callback)-> setTimeout (()-> callback "Finished in 1 sec...with #{x} #{y} #{Date.now()}"),1000
    
    # if you want to run all in parallel, they will approximately finish at the same time
    
    for i in [0..10] 
      sChris i,i+1,(r)->
       console.log r
    
    # now you can serialize this function, and it will finish in 10 seconds, running one after another
    
    serializedExampleFunction = serializer exampleFunction
    
    for i in [10..10]
      serializedExampleFunction i,(r)->
       console.log r

## Installation

    $ npm install serializer
